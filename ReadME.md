This project focuses on practising JavaScript DOM (Document Object Model) manipulation by dynamically creating a restaurant homepage. It highlights skills in structuring, updating, and managing webpage elements programmatically, showcasing practical applications of JavaScript in front-end development.

The content is inspired by the Bistro Huddy series, a comedy web show created by Drew Talbert and Andrea Kelley. The series follows the humorous comings and goings of the titular restaurant, drawing from their personal experiences as staff. All rights to their content belong to them, and this project is for educational purposes only.
